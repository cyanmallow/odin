    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade chocolate cake recipe is super easy to prepare in one bowl for a deliciously moist and fluffy chocolate cake. This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had! Frost with your favorite frosting.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        2 cups white sugar<br>
        1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour<br>
        ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
        1 ½ teaspoons baking powder<br>
        1 ½ teaspoons baking soda<br>
        1 teaspoon salt<br>
        2 large eggs<br>
        1 cup milk<br>
        ½ cup vegetable oil<br>
        2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
        1 cup boiling water<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        Gather all ingredients.<br>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.<br>
        Stir sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.<br>
        Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla; mix for 2 minutes on medium speed with an electric mixer.<br>
        Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin.<br>
        Pour evenly into the prepared pans.<br>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br>
