    <p>
        Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.<br>
        Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.<br>
        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.<br>
        Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.<br>

        Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.<br>
        Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.<br>
        Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.<br>
